			'<p>Eating Disorders have a way of taking over your life. By the time you\'ve gotten to this website, you\'ve probably tried to stop the obsession on your own. Most people with eating disorders excel in many ways and it\'s hard for them to understand why they can\'t get this under control. Your friends and family, if they know, may not know how to support you.</p>',
			'<p>I\'m here to help. I want you to be able to smile genuinely when you look in the mirror. I want you to have time and energy to focus on the things in life that matter more to you than food, appearance, and exercise. We can work towards discovering who you are without the eating disorder, and loving that person.</p>',

			'<h1>FAQ\'s and Common Concerns</h1>',
			'<h2>Why is this happening to me?</h2>',
			'<p>Unfortunately, there isn\'t a simple answer to this. For some, it\'s obvious: disordered eating behaviors correlate with a traumatic event or long term family issues. Others are unsure why they have eating disorders; their lives have been good and the people in their lives love them. Social pressures and media often exacerbate low self-esteem and negative body image. The onset of mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety, make some people feel out of control. For many, vigilantly attending to food or weight becomes a comfort. Regardless, people with eating disorders all have one thing in common - they have experienced a level of intense emotion and did not know what to do with it. Learning to express emotions appropriately can reduce eating disordered behavior. Identifying the needs the eating disorder is meeting (i.e., control, attention, comfort, self-punishment) and finding alternative ways to meet these needs can also decrease symptoms.</p>',
			
			'<h2>I don\'t think it\'s all that deep. I just can\'t seem to get skinny enough that I\'m happy.</h2>',
			'<p>If eating disorders were really about food and weight, you would be able to stop on your own. You wouldn\'t have fallen into the traps of binge eating, purging, over-exercising and/or restricting. Any unhealthy attempt to lose weight indicates a problem with self care. Exploring why you choose not to take care of yourself, or lack the motivation to treat yourself well can be helpful. Obsessing over weight, food, exercise, or appearance can impede your social life, academic or work performance, and quality of life.</p>',
			
			'<h2>If I recover, will I get fat?</h2>',
			'<p>Recovery requires you to take care of your body. That means maintaining the weight that\'s healthiest for you by listening to your body\'s cues and exercising in ways that feel good to you. I have never worked with someone who took good care of her/his body and became unhealthy.</p>',
			
			'<h2>What should I know about recovering from an eating disorder?</h2>',
			'<p>While you are working on recovery, all of the same external pressures will still be there. You will continue to see people you compare yourself to. Meals will still need to be eaten. People in your life who commented on your appearance before may continue to do so. Your disordered eating has served a purpose and now you will attempt to face these challenges with healthier coping skills. Recovering from any problem is rarely as fluid and easy as we would hope. There are usually "slips" where a person reverts to old behaviors. Instead of seeing these as failure or "relapse", it is helpful to view them as part of the process of healing. No one is perfect and trying to be has made you sick. I will help you navigate this with an eye on progress, not perfection.</p>',

			'<p>Research shows that the single most important factor in effective therapy is the relationship between the therapist and the client. My goal is for you to feel supported and respected no matter what you tell me or how you tell me. I will never pry information out of you. I trust you to tell me information you think is important when you feel safe doing so. I welcome any questions, concerns, or dissatisfactions you may have about our work together at any time. My job is to earn your trust.</p>',
			'<p>Working with me will most likely involve attending to current concerns in your life as well as how those concerns developed in the first place. I believe working at both levels is essential in truly being able to make meaningful and lasting change.</p>',
			'<p>In the first session I will help you come up with “treatment goals,” which will guide our work together. I typically meet with people weekly at first and taper to every other week as clients begin to heal and their pain subsides.</p>',

			'<img class="img" src="img/headshot.jpg" alt="Allison Puryear" />',
			'<p>I have been working with people with eating disorders since 2001. After working at an inpatient eating disorder treatment center I coordinated the Eating Disorder Treatment Team within the University of Georgia\'s Health Center. I have had private practices in Athens, Georgia, Seattle, Washington & Asheville, North Carolina. I have earned the distinction of being a Certified Eating Disorder Specialist by the International Association of Eating Disorder Professionals.</p>',
			'<p>I love working with people with eating disorders because they tend to be intelligent, sensitive, driven people who accomplish so much once their anxious energy is channeled in a healthy way. I enjoy working with people in their late teens, twenties, and thirties, because establishing healthy communication and appreciation of self early allows people to enjoy their lives much more. Helping free up my clients over 40 from what has been a lifetime of self-reproach is incredibly rewarding.</p>',
			'<p>Though I have a specialty in eating disorder treatment, I have experience working with a variety of mental health concerns, especially sexual trauma and anxiety disorders. I have worked with people aged 4 to 66, with at-risk youth and college students, with people with psychosis and those who just feel blue. I have been a forensic interviewer and spent two years working exclusively with survivors of sexual trauma. I have been in the mental health field since 1998. I attended the University of Georgia for both undergrad and graduate school. I am licensed as a Clinical Social Worker in North Carolina and as an Independent Clinical Social Worker in Washington.</p>',

			'<h2>Clinical Supervision</h2>',
			'<p>Whether you are a new graduate or fully licensed, I would love the chance to help you feel more competent in your practice. With special training & experience working with clients with eating disorders, sexual trauma & anxiety, I can offer ethical evidence-based guidance. I\'m an iaedp approved supervisor for those seeking their Certified Eating Disorder Specialist designation. I am a good fit for therapists who want to work on being more directive, those who want to get out of the rut of supportive counseling, roll up their sleeves and have the hard but compassionate conversations that lead to empowerment & change. I\'m also a good fit for therapists who feel overburdened, burned out & want to reconnect to the joy of providing therapy. Contact me to schedule an initial, free meeting to see if we will work well together or if we\'ve met, click the Schedule Now button to schedule supervision.</p>',
			'<h2>Business Consultation</h2>',
			'<p>When I worked in agencies, I longed for the autonomy & financial compensation of private practice. I was intimidated by the business side of things- working with insurance, getting referrals and creating efficient systems. I read books; I had business consultations; I picked the brains of so many private practitioners. When I took the risk, I was rewarded beyond my expectations and have loved practice building ever since. Having built practices in 3 cities (Athens, GA, Seattle, WA & Asheville), I am confident in my ability to help you do the same. I am passionate about helping clinicians feel safe enough to take the leap that leads to work/life balance, less burn out & more freedom. There are so many fantastic providers working too much for too little because of fear.
