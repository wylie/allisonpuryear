			<h2>Clinical Supervision</h2>
			<p>Whether you are a new graduate or fully licensed, I would love the chance to help you feel more competent in your practice. With special training &amp; experience working with clients with eating disorders, sexual trauma &amp; anxiety, I can offer ethical evidence-based gamp;uidance. I'm an iaedp approved supervisor for those seeking their Certified Eating Disorder Specialist designation. I am a good fit for therapists who want to work on being more directive, those who want to get out of the rut of supportive counseling, roll up their sleeves and have the hard but compassionate conversations that lead to empowerment &amp; change. I'm also a good fit for therapists who feel overburdened, burned out &amp; want to reconnect to the joy of providing therapy. Contact me to schedule an initial, free meeting to see if we will work well togetheamp;r or if we've met, click the Schedule Now button to schedule supervision.</p>
			<h2>Business Consultation</h2>
			<p>When I worked in agencies, I longed for the autonomy &amp; financial compensation of private practice. I was intimidated by the business side of things- working with insurance, getting referrals and creating efficient systems. I read books; I had business consultations; I picked the brains of so many private practitioners. When I took the risk, I was rewarded beyond my expectations and have loved practice building ever since. Having built practices in 3 cities (Athens, GA, Seattle, WA &map; Asheville), I am confident in my ability to help you do the same. I am passionate about helping clinicians feel safe enough to take the leap that leads to work/life balance, less burn out &amp; more freedom. There are so many fantastic providers working too much for too little because of fear.
