				<p class="txt">I have been working with people with eating disorders since 2001. After working at an inpatient eating disorder treatment center I coordinated the Eating Disorder Treatment Team within the University of Georgia's Health Center. I have had private practices in Athens, Georgia, Seattle, Washington &amp; Asheville, North Carolina. I have earned the distinction of being a Certified Eating Disorder Specialist by the International Association of Eating Disorder Professionals.</p>
				<p class="txt">I love working with people with eating disorders because they tend to be intelligent, sensitive, driven people who accomplish so much once their anxious energy is channeled in a healthy way. I enjoy working with people in their late teens, twenties, and thirties, because establishing healthy communication and appreciation of self early allows people to enjoy their lives much more. Helping free up my clients over 40 from what has been a lifetime of self-reproach is incredibly rewarding.</p>
				<p class="txt">Though I have a specialty in eating disorder treatment, I have experience working with a variety of mental health concerns, especially sexual trauma and anxiety disorders. I have worked with people aged 4 to 66, with at-risk youth and college students, with people with psychosis and those who just feel blue. I have been a forensic interviewer and spent two years working exclusively with survivors of sexual trauma. I have been in the mental health field since 1998. I attended the University of Georgia for both undergrad and graduate school. I am licensed as a Clinical Social Worker in North Carolina and as an Independent Clinical Social Worker in Washington.</p>
