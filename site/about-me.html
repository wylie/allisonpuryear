		<p>I have been working with people with eating disorders since 2001. After working at an inpatient eating disorder treatment center I coordinated the Eating Disorder Treatment Team within the University of Georgiaâ€™s Health Center.</p>
		<p>I love working with people with eating disorders because they tend to be intelligent, sensitive, driven people who accomplish so much once their anxious energy is channeled in a healthy way. I enjoy working with people in their late teens, twenties, and thirties, because establishing healthy communication and appreciation of self early allows people to enjoy their lives much more.</p>
		<p>Though I have a specialty in eating disorder treatment, I have experience working with a variety of mental health concern, especially sexual trauma and anxiety disorders. I have worked with people aged 4 to 66, with at-risk youth and college students, with people with psychosis and those who just feel blue. I have been a forensic interviewer and spent two years working exclusively with survivors of sexual trauma. I have been in the mental health field since 1998. I attended the University of Georgia for both undergrad and graduate school. I am licensed as an Independent Clinical Social Worker in Georgia and Washington.</p>
