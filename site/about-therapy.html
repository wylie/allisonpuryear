		<h1>Psychotherapy that focuses on the therapy part.</h1>
		<p>Research shows that the single most important factor in effective therapy is the relationship between the therapist and the client. My goal is for you to feel supported and respected no matter what you tell me or how you tell me. I will never pry information out of you. I trust you to tell me information you think is important when you feel safe doing so. I welcome any questions, concerns, or dissatisfactions you may have about our work together at any time. My job is to earn your trust.</p>
		<p>Working with me will most likely involve attending to current concerns in your life as well as how those concerns developed in the first place. I believe working at both levels is essential in truly being able to make meaningful and lasting change.</p>
		<p>Individual therapy sessions, held in the office shown above, are 45-50 minutes long. In the first session I will help you come up with “treatment goals,” which will guide our work together. I typically meet with people weekly at first and taper to every other week as clients begin to heal and their pain subsides.</p>
		<p>Many people find that group therapy is very effective. I will be facilitating an Eating Disorder therapy group and a Sexual Trauma Survivors’ Group. Other helpful groups in the Seattle area can be found <a href="http://www.counselingseattle.com/resources/support-group.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
