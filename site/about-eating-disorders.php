		<h1>You can’t change your life until you start changing your life.</h1>
		<p>Eating Disorders have a way of taking over your life. By the time you’ve gotten to this website, you’ve probably tried to stop the obsession on your own. Most people with eating disorders excel in many ways and it’s hard for them to understand why they can’t get this under control. Your friends and family, if they know, may not know how to support you.</p>
		<p>I’m here to help. I want you to be able to smile genuinely when you look in the mirror. I want you to have time and energy to focus on the things in life that matter more to you than food, appearance, and exercise. We can work towards discovering who you are without the eating disorder, and loving that person.</p>
		<p>To schedule an appointment, click on the "Scheduling Now" tab to the right.</p>
		<p>For any questions, I can be reached at (206) 972-0898 or allisonpuryear@icloud.com (please no that email is not considered a secure form of communication)</p>
